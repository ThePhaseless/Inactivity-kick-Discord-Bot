# Inactivity Check Discord Bot
Here is mine simple bot that will list or bans users that didn't said anything in channel that the command is used. Only the owner can use it (open source allows to change it).

**BE SURE TO ENABLE INTENTS IN DISCORD DEV BOT SETTINGS**

You also will need to provide these secrets: (you can copy it directly to repl.it custom json)
>      {
>       "clientId": "Your_Client_ID",
>       "token": "Bots_secret_token",
>       "guildId": "Your_server"
>     }

Best to fork it on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/@ThePhaseless/Inactivity-check-Discord-Bot)
